# Avionics

This repo is meant to contain the code for the microcontrollers on each board
and the Altium Designer files associated with the design of each board. When
adding your own stuff, try to stick with the folder naming convention and
structure seen here.

## Libraries
The libraries with the 'PARSEC' file name contain components that are generally
shared across the boards. If you need to add components for a project, add
them in a separate library file and add that file to the 'libraries' directory.

The csv with the file name
lm317_10V_2018PCB_load_cell_calibration.csv
contains calibration data for PARSEC's load cells, as driven by the 
following hardware:

	* 10 V rail from a LM317 linear regulator, outputting 10.21 V when under
	  load from all three load cells (each is a 350 ohm wheatstone bridge).
	  It's input was 12 V from an ATX power supply.

	* The forse [sic] sensor board designed in 2018 by Christine Yu and
	  Alexi Garcia. It is based on an STM32F446VE microcontroller with
	  12 bit ADCs. The load cell exitation is scaled to 3.3 V by an
	  INA-125 instrumentation amplifier.

	* Dumbells from the Caltech gym were used to apply known amounts of force.

	* Tension measurements were performed by tying a loop around a pullup
	  bar and hooking the load cell into it, and made a loop to hang from the
	  other end of the load cell to hang dumbells from. The 50 and 100 pound
	  dumbells (the kind used for bicep curls) were used.

	* Compression measurements were performed by trying to place dumbells
	  on top of the load cell sitting on the ground. Getting it to balance
	  with any type of dumbell was difficult.

The measurements were taken on 23 Jan 2020.
